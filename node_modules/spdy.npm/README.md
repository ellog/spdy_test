# SPDY Server for node.js  [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/indutny/node-spdy.png)](http://travis-ci.org/indutny/node-spdy)

With this module you can create [SPDY](http://www.chromium.org/spdy) servers
in node.js with natural http module interface and fallback to regular https
(for browsers that doesn't support SPDY yet).

It's using SSL's NPN feature that is available in node from 0.6.0 version, but
requires you to build node with latest openssl.

## Node+OpenSSL building

At the moment node-spdy requires zlib dictionary support, which will come to
node.js only in 0.7.x version. To build 0.7.x version follow instructions below:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/joyent/node.git
cd node
./configure --prefix=$HOME/.node/dev # <- or any other dir

make install -j4 # in -jN, N is number of CPU cores on your machine

# Add node's bin to PATH env variable
echo 'export PATH=$HOME/.node/dev/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc

#
# You have working node 0.7.x + NPN now !!!
#
```

## Usage

```javascript
var spdy = require('spdy');

var options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-cert.pem'),
  ca: fs.readFileSync(__dirname + '/keys/spdy-csr.pem')
};

spdy.createServer(options, function(req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200);
  res.end('hello world!');
});

spdy.listen(443);
```

### API

API is compatible with `http` and `https` module, but you can use another
function as base class for SPDYServer. For example,
`require('express').HTTPSServer` given that as base class you'll get a server
compatible with [express](https://github.com/visionmedia/express) API.

```javascript
spdy.createServer(
  [base class constructor, i.e. https.Server or express.HTTPSServer],
  { /* keys and options */ }, // <- the only one required argument
  [request listener]
).listen([port], [host], [callback]);
```

Request listener will receive two arguments: `request` and `response`. They're
both instances of `http`'s `IncomingMessage` and `OutgoingMessage`. But two
custom properties are added to both of them: `streamID` and `isSpdy`. The first
one indicates on which spdy stream are sitting request and response. Latter one
is always true and can be checked to ensure that incoming request wasn't
received by HTTPS callback.
